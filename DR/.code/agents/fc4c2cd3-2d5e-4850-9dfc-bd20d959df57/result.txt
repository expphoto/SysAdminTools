### **Key Tradeoffs & Recommendations**

1. **PowerShell Version Strategy:**
   - **Primary:** PowerShell 5.1 for maximum domain compatibility
   - **Future:** PowerShell 7+ features as secondary enhancement
   - **Rationale:** Domain operations require mature AD module support

2. **Concurrency Approach:**
   - **Default:** 20-40 concurrent operations (configurable)
   - **Network-bound:** Higher concurrency for connectivity tests
   - **CPU-bound:** Lower concurrency for role detection
   - **Safety:** Circuit breaker patterns for resource protection

3. **Error Handling Philosophy:**
   - **Fail-fast:** Invalid configurations and permissions
   - **Resilient:** Network and service transient failures  
   - **Observable:** Comprehensive logging at every decision point
   - **Recoverable:** Clear guidance for manual intervention

This comprehensive plan provides a robust foundation for implementing a production-ready disaster recovery auto-start orchestration system that meets all specified requirements while maintaining safety, observability, and operational efficiency.
